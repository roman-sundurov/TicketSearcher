I've created an iOS app called TicketSearcher, which is a price aggregator for plane and hotel tickets. It was developed as a test task for the Effective Mobile company using pre-made Figma layouts. My main objectives were to create the first screen for viewing air ticket prices and other screens to prepare for later development.

- Language: Swift
- Interface: SwiftUI
- Architecture: MVVM + Coordinator
- Package dependencies: SPM
- Frameworks: ï»¿Combine, Alamofire, SwiftLint
- CI/CD: Xcode Cloud
- Other: Git-Flow, RESTful API

## Features
The minimal deployment version is iOS 16.0
The application uses 3 different API calls:
1. https://run.mocky.io/v3/214a1713-bac0-4853-907c-a1dfc3cd05fd
2. https://run.mocky.io/v3/7e55bf02-89ff-4847-9eb7-7d83ef884017
3. https://run.mocky.io/v3/670c3d56-7f03-4237-9e34-d437a9e56ebf

The TestFlight link will be available after Apple finishes its moderation process.
The approximate time it took to complete the task was 2.5 workdays.

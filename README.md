I've created an iOS app called TicketSearcher, which is a price aggregator for plane and hotel tickets. It was developed as a test task for the Effective Mobile company using pre-made Figma layouts. My main objectives were to create the first screen for viewing air ticket prices and other screens to prepare for later development.

- Language: Swift
- Interface: SwiftUI
- Architecture: MVVM + Coordinator
- Package dependencies: SPM
- Frameworks: ï»¿Combine, Alamofire, SwiftLint
- CI/CD: Xcode Cloud
- Other: Git-Flow, RESTful API

The TestFlight link will be available after Apple finishes its moderation process.
The approximate time it took to complete the task was 2.5 workdays.
